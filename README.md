## Hi there 👋
✔ I am a JavaScript full stack developer working at Cognizant Softvision and I look forward to develop my technical and soft skills.

✔ Currently I am working with __✨React, ✨NextJS, ✨Redux, ✨Node.js,✨Express, ✨AWS Lamda, ✨Ember.js, ✨HTML, ✨CSS/SASS, ✨PostgreSql, ✨Jest, ✨Git__.

✔ On the previous job I worked at UNIQA Software on a big project with Java for the backend and JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. The technologies used on the project are: __Java, JEE, JSF, Struts, EJB, JSP, HTML, JS, jQuery, CSS, Maven, PostgreSQL, Hibernate, Mockito, SVN.__

✔ I like to take new and hard challenges to learn new things and to expand my technical and soft skills. I want to bring value though my work and I want to deliver applications and features that are offering users a good experience having a great design and flawless functionality.
