## Hi there üëã
‚úî I am a junior full stack developer working at UNIQA Software and I look forward to develop my technical and soft skills.

‚úî Currently I am working on a big project with Java for the backend and JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. The technologies used on the project are: __Java, JEE, JSF, Struts, EJB, JSP, HTML, JS, jQuery, CSS, Maven, PostgreSQL, Hibernate, Mockito, SVN.__

‚úî As I worked on multiple personal projects, such as: [tourism application](https://github.com/grigoar/tourism-frontend-AngularJS)-Angular+Spring-Boot, [quiz me up](https://github.com/grigoar/Quiz-me-up-Android)-Android, or [my personal website](https://www.grigorenath.com/)-JS+CSS+HTML and other small or medium applications, I am proficient on developing projects with other technologies like: __React, Spring Boot, Angular, TypeScript, Android, Kotlin, MySQL, SASS, GitHub.__

‚úî I like to take new and hard challenge to learn new things and to expand my technical and soft skills. I want to bring value though my work and I want to deliver applications and features that are offering users a good experience with both design and functionality.

## ‚≠êCurrently, in my free time I am learning React and working to develop some applications to enhance and test my knowledge.

### __üöÄCurrency Exchange App__
- This is a React application which is about calculating the exchange rate of the currencies based on an external API and it is hosted on the github-pages https://grigoar.github.io/React-Currency-Exchange-App/ .
### __üöÄTouch typing App__
- This is a React application about speed typing and which is using continuous deployment on Netlify https://touch-typing-demo.netlify.app/ .
