### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I am a junior full stack developer working at UNIQA Software and I look forward to develop my technical and soft skills.

- Currently I am working on a big project with Java for the backend and JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. The technologies used on the project are: Java, JEE, JSF, Struts, EJB, JSP, HTML, JS, jQuery, CSS, Maven, PostgreSQL, Hibernate, Mockito, SVN.

- As I worked on multiple personal projects, I am also proficient on developing projects with other technologies like: Spring Boot, Angular, React, TypeScript, Android, Kotlin, MySQL, GitHub.

- I like to learn new things and I always want to expand my technical and soft skills. I want to bring value though my work and I want to deliver applications and features that are offering users a good experience with both design and functionality.

#### Currently, in my free time I am learning React and working to develop some applications to enhance and test my knowledge.

- One sample of a React application developed by me is the Currency Exchange App that is hosted on the github-pages https://grigoar.github.io/React-Currency-Exchange-App/ .
